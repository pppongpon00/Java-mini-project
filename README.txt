MY MINI JAVA PROJECT'S DESCRIBTION

THIS IS MY PROGRAMING FUNDAMETAL II PROJECT THAT I DO IT MY SELF,
MY PROGRAM NAME IS "GRADE CALCULATOR" IT'S CONNECT WITH DATABASE WITH "XAMPP"
TO MAKE HOST OF DATABASE IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE MY PROGRAM TO USE WITH YOUR COMPUTER
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE "HOST" LOCATION INSIDE MY CODE IN ALL CLASS 
AND CREATE 4 TABLES THAT IT HAVE -> USERNAME, PASSWORD, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME AND PERSONAL_CODE
FOR SIGN _UP AND SIGN_IN THIS PROGRAM BEFORE USE.
 
AFTER YOU REGISTER IF YOU FORGOT YOUR PASSWORD IT HAS "FORGET PASSWORD" BUTTON 
FOR PEOPLE WHO FORGET HIS/HER PASSWORD,AFTER YOU LOGIN THE PROGRAM 
YOU HAVE TO CHECK THE "RADIO BUTTON" BEFORE YOU INPUT IN "TEXTFIELD"

I DEFAULT VALUE OF GRADE F AT 50, AND IT BUTTON TO CHANGE TO 40 AT THE TOP LEFT OF THE WINDOW
AND I DEFAULT SUBJECT'S CREDIT WITH 3,IF YOU HAVE INPUT IT! AND HOMEWORK/CLASSROOM SCORE
TOO IDEFAULT IT TO 0 IF YOU HAVE INPUT IT!!.

ONLY MIDTERM SCORE THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TO INPUT, ANOTHER TEXTBOX ARE NOT TO INPUT
EXCEPT SUBJECT'S CREDIT AND HOMEWORK/CLASSROMM SCORE IS UP TO YOU, BUT TEXTBOX OF "YOUR GRADE"
AND "NEED SCORE TO INCREASE" IS NOT TO INPUT.

AFTER YOU INPUT YOUR SCORE AND CLICK AT "CALCULATE" BUTTON IT WILL CALCULATE YOUR GRADE
AND SHOW ON TEXTBOX OF "YOUR GRADE" AND "NEED SCORE TO INCREASE" FOR YOU CAN DICISTION
TO DROP THAT SUBJECT AND SHOW HOW MANY SCORE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN NEXT EXAMINATION.

THIS IS JUST SIMPLE PROJECT JAVA OF ME, IM SORRY IF IT HAVE SOME BUG BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I SHOULD TEST WITH WHICH TEXT CASE, BUT I VERY CONFIDENT MY PROGRAM IS WORK PROPERLY
ALTHOUGH IT HAVE MANY WASTE CODE OR FUNCTION SUCH AS PERSONAL_CODE I THINK I HAVE TO USE IT 
FIRST TIME BUT I HAVE TOO MANK WORK TO DO (3 SUBJECT'S PROJECT ) SO I HAVE TO CUT IT OF,
I HOPE YOU LIKE THIS YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THIS PROGRAM TO STUDY OR ANYTHING FOR FREE IF YOU WANT , 
I DO MY BEST FOR MY PROGRAM THANK YOU.<3
